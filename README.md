Class Project

# Introduction
Joy Buolamwini, in her TED talk on algorithmic bias, mentions how fast bias can spread online. In the wake of Milo Yiannopoulus's speaking tour last year, one of the critiques I kept hearing about the counter-protesters is that they "burned shit, knocked people unconscious, and hit women". This separation between people and women seemed to spread quickly as a way to admonish those that protested Milo's talks. Below is an attempt to map the spread of this phrase through the internet. 
Although the origins of this story can most likely associated with Kiara Robles being hit with a flag pole, this project focuses less on the origins of the story and more on its evolution.

# Methods
Without the use of keyword or text scraping software, the data collection for this project was simply done through google searches. As a result of this the data set I am using for analysis is by no means complete, but rather a hopefully insightful snapshot.
